        <h1>MT-ASA Chapter Meeting 2025 Schedule and Details</h1>
        <p>Date and Time: October 3rd, 2025 (Friday); 9:30 AM - 4 PM </p>
        <p>Location: Wilson 001 is in the basement of Wilson Hall on the MSU campus </p>
        <p> Note: The room is best accessed via the entrance that faces Jabbs Hall or via the stairs from the first floor near the Northwest corner that leads to that same exit. If you've ever entered Wilson after walking by the Bobcat statue, you probably walked by the room. It is also near the location the elevator goes to in the basement, not that we recommend using that elevator... </p>
        <p> If you need to park on campus, the Harrison Street visitor parking is closest but the parking garage might be easier: <a href="https://www.montana.edu/parking/directions.html" target="_blank">https://www.montana.edu/parking/directions.html</a> </p>
