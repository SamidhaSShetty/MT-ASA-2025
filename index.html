            Title: A Simple Bayesian Approach To Detecting Changepoints Across Multiple Samples
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract:  Changepoints are abrupt changes in sequential data.  The presence of multiple samples should, in theory, help to reveal subtle changepoints within noisy data. However, multi-sample changepoint detection methods are rarely used in practice because existing inference methods are complex and inefficient.   In this talk, we present a simple, fast, and effective approach to detecting changepoints across multiple samples.  By transforming Bayesian multi-sample changepoint models into unconventional Hidden Markov Models, we achieve fast, closed-form approximations to the posterior distributions on changepoint probabilities, segmentations, and latent parameters.  We present promising initial results on simulated data, and consider the problem of identifying copy number alterations in cancer biopsy samples with low tumor fractions.

            Title: The more we learn, the less we know: Interrogating our methods with a little philosophy
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract:  Most education in statistical inference starts from the implicit assumption that a decision has already been made to use statistical methods as a primary tool for addressing a scientific question.  From that implicit decision, educational and professional discussions tend to be methods-focused, emphasizing learning of existing methods through technical recipes, as well development of new methods, all conditional on currently accepted frameworks and assumptions.  A great deal of authority has been handed over to statistical results in our current scientific culture with relatively little questioning.  There are few opportunities to step back and consider the historical and philosophical foundations underlying the current paradigms we operate within.  An inherent part of science is the willingness to interrogate our methods and that requires exposure to broader contexts and nurturing of a willingness to recognize the narrow ways of seeing we often operate under.  While opening up the door to seeing deeper limitations of our methods can be discomforting and humbling at first, it can also lead to approaching problems with more creativity and fun.  The hope for this talk is to generate curiosity and motivation for individuals to expose themselves to history and philosophy of science, as a starting place to realizing how much we don’t know, which in turn gives us insight into how to interrogate our work in deeper way. As Richard Feynman famously said: “I would rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned.”

            Title: Making Monitoring Matter Through Strong Statistical Collaborations
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract:  For long-term monitoring program viability there is a premium on sound statistical underpinnings, particularly for taxa that contribute economic impacts either negatively (invasive weeds estimated $34 billion/yr) or positively (bats as agricultural pest eaters estimated $3.7 to $53 billion/yr and pollinators estimated $200 billion/yr). The critical statistical elements when conducting field-based surveys are the spatio-temporal design (which determines when and where to sample and how many locations for data collection) and the inference design (which outlines the statistical analysis to answer program objectives). I will overview my efforts since 2007 to assist natural resource monitoring programs in their goal to “make monitoring matter.” Applied statisticians begin by understanding our collaborator’s science and information needs. Then, we investigate whether the current study design and/or statistical analyses used to attack their problem fail to capture critical aspects that, if ignored, can lead to misleading conclusions. Those situations in which the conventional approaches fall short motivate us to discover innovative statistical solutions. I will highlight examples of cost-efficient and optimal sampling designs we have developed for bats, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, and a long-lived tree species. Additionally, I will share some collaborations that led to novel statistical methods that infuse biological realism and, consequently, provide deeper ecological insights from field-based data. We focus on, and are motivated by, the need for practical, solution-oriented guidance that can be adopted and implemented by agency and academic scientists.

            Title: Applying Bayesian Additive Regression Trees to Bat Roost Discovery
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a statistical learning method that couples Bayesian inference with the strengths of tree-ensemble machine learning methods such as Random Forests (RF) and boosting. As a result of this pairing, BART i) excels at capturing non-linear patterns in high-dimensional data, ii) provides excellent out-of-box predictive capabilities, while being easy to use and implement, and iii) provides uncertainty estimation of predicted quantities through a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that samples from the posterior distribution of trees and their terminal nodes in the ensemble. We apply BART to the problem of predicting bat roost locations, which is an important first step for surveillance of coronaviruses among bat populations in the Southern US. We use remotely sensed environmental covariates to predict presence of bat roosts and compare its performance against competing models (e.g., a generalized linear model and a support vector machine). We also highlight a Shiny web application that makes our model predictions accessible to land managers.

            Title: Random forest methods for ordinal response data with an application to metabolomics
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract: Methods for analyzing ordered categorical response data (ordinal data) often exploit only one aspect of these data, either the categorical nature or ordered nature, but not both at the same time. Further, when applied to random forest models, a question remains as to the best way to handle this type of response. We explore four such approaches (multi-class, quantitative, ordinal score-based, and ordered class score-free) and compare them using 79 metabolomics profiles of synovial fluid from osteoarthritis patients with 5 classes of severity of disease. In addition, NHANES data of classifications of risk of kidney disease (3 classes), with real covariates and 5,000 simulated predictor variables, is used to assess the methodologies for a larger sample size. This exploration will guide the analysis of an expected 1,200 samples of metabolomic profiles from synovial fluid with an ordinal response.

            Title: Accounting for Correlated Latent Parameters in Information Criterion
            </p>
        <p>
            Abstract: For the purpose of model assessment, various “Information Criteria” may be viewed as approximations to unbiased estimates of out of sample prediction accuracy. In essence, measures of information criterion make bias adjustments to predictive likelihood with the aim of circumventing the additional data and computational requirements necessary for cross validation. These criterions are conveniently implemented in many statistical software and are widely used for the purpose of model selection. However, in the domain of state space modelling, current adjustments for bias are mis-aligned with state space model structure and may over-penalize otherwise well performing models – namely, correlated latent parameters aren't well accounted for in classical information criterion. Additionally, those information criteria that do account for correlated latent parameters, such as WAIC, also require a full markov chain monte carlo analysis. In this brief talk, I use an example problem to outline the issues between state space models and classical information criterion and describe work aimed towards correcting for their over-penalization.
